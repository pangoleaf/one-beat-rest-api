# One Beat Rest API

In order to demonstrate the construction of a working API built using Spring Boot for my final QA Bootcamp project I've created a system for storing metadata about music, structured as artists, albums and tracks.

I felt it would not be too difficult to get the basics of this down, but that perfecting it and learning new packages and possible features to include would be the tricky bit. 

In the end I found that adding complexity to an application when learning certain things for the first time can have an exponential effect on time taken. 

Overall I'm very happy though as I managed to learn and implement relational entities, Lombok and custom filtering of GET results, which was all beyond what was taught, and ironing out the creases of all of that really solidified my understanding of Java and Spring as a whole. With all this in mind I still was able to achieve 94.5% test coverage. 

Further features I would like to add include a basic html/javascript/css front-end (or React/Vue once I've learned them), and deploying the app to Heroku or a similar service.
